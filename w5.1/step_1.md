## Step 1: Luck check

In some countries of the former Soviet Union there was a belief about lucky tickets. A transport ticket of any sort was believed to possess luck if sum of digits on the left half of its number was equal to the sum of digits on the right half. Here are examples of such numbers:

003111    #         3 = 1 + 1 + 1

813372    # 8 + 1 + 3 = 3 + 7 + 2

17935     #     1 + 7 = 3 + 5

56328116


Such tickets were either eaten after being used or collected for bragging rights.

Your task is to write a method luck_check(str), which returns true if the argument is a string decimal representation of a lucky ticket number, or false for all other numbers.
