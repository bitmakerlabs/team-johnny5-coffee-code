# Step Three: Combining arrays

```ruby
numbers = ['2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10', 'J', 'Q', 'K', 'A']
suits = ['spades', 'hearts', 'diamonds', 'clubs']
```

Use numbers and suits to construct the following array (represents the 52 cards in a deck): [["2", "spades"], ["3", "spades"] ... ["K", "clubs"], ["A", "clubs"]]


BONUS: Why wouldn't we be able to turn this into a hash like last week's example?
