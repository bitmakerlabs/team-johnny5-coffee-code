# Step Two: Find the longest word

Write a method called "find_longest" that accepts an array and finds the longest word

Example usage:

```ruby
animals = %w(cow chicken sheep)

find_longest(animals) # => "chicken"
```

Test data:
```ruby
colours = %w(red blue green yellow chartreuse orange periwinkle tomato cobalt)
```
